-----------------------------------------------------------
Limit thinking time by ... :
    Select how to limit the computer thinking.
    Time spent is unpredictable
    when Depth or Nodes is selected.
  Default : applys the mode shown.
  Depth : at the depth ends the iterative deepening search.
  Node : stops thinking after searched nodes reach to this.
  Computer's Time
    After total time(min.) is spent all,
    It makes each move in extra time(sec.).
    Optional (Depth) value can be used if you want Bonanza
    to stop thinking after the iterative
    deepening searches reach sufficient depth.

    Apply time limit :
        With some allowance :
          If total-time is 0, allows to think longer up to
          extra-time*5.

Book use. :
    On : enable to probe the opening book.
    Narrow : selects move from a small set of opening moves.
    Off : disable to probe the opening book.

No Pondering : disables thinks on the opponent's time.

Number of Thread : the number of threads to be created
    when considering a move to make.
    Max value is 4. It was reduced from original value(12)
    to reduce memory requirement.

Resign Threshold : threshold to resign.
    The larger, never resign. Default is about 990.
    Lower limit is 174 and it is value of two pawns.
    (Dragon is 945, Horse is 827, Rook is 642)
    Computer may resign at start when handicap is set
    and this value is too small.
